# X-Ray frontend

The production frontend lives here. It is a Nuxt 4 application built on Vue 3's Composition API and TypeScript, with Vite for development and builds, Nitro for the server boundary, Pinia for client state, and TanStack Vue Query for remote state.

## Run locally

The Nuxt toolchain requires a supported Node release. This workspace pins Node 22.22 in `.nvmrc`.

```bash
cd frontend
nvm install
nvm use
corepack enable
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

The app works with a small Nitro-hosted development portfolio out of the box. To use the existing FastAPI service, copy `.env.example` to `.env`, start the backend on port 8080, and set:

```bash
XRAY_API_BASE=http://localhost:8080
```

Nitro then forwards `/api/companies` to the backend, keeping the browser on a same-origin API.

## Structure

- `app/pages/`: file-based routes.
- `app/components/`: reusable product surfaces.
- `app/stores/`: Pinia UI state.
- `app/composables/`: TanStack Query server-state hooks.
- `app/assets/css/`: design tokens and global component foundations.
- `server/api/`: Nitro server endpoints and backend adapters.
- `DESIGN_SYSTEM.md`: the translated X-Ray design system and usage rules.

## Checks

```bash
pnpm typecheck
pnpm build
```

## Troubleshooting

If Rolldown reports that `format` received `['underline', 'gray']`, the terminal is using Node 21 or
another unsupported release. Run `nvm use` inside this directory, confirm `node --version` reports
`v22.22.0`, and reinstall with `pnpm install`. The strict engine check now stops earlier with a clear
version error when the runtime is unsupported.
